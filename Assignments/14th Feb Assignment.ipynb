    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why it is used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python threading allows you to have different parts of your program run concurrently and can simplify your design. Important to note that Python virtual machine is not a thread-safe interpreter, meaning that the interpreter can execute only one thread at any given moment. This limitation is enforced by the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which essentially limits one Python thread to run at a time. In other words, GIL ensures that only one thread runs within the same process at the same time on a single processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Basically, threading may not speed up all tasks. The I/O-bound tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events have a better chance of taking advantage of threading than CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "    1. Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory.\n",
    "    2. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Python virtual machine is not a thread-safe interpreter, meaning that the interpreter can execute only one thread at any given moment. This limitation is enforced by the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which essentially limits one Python thread to run at a time. In other words, GIL ensures that only one thread runs within the same process at the same time on a single processor. Basically, threading may not speed up all tasks. The I/O-bound tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events have a better chance of taking advantage of threading than CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "### Q6. Explain Dead Locks and race conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Dead Locks</b>: \n",
    "> A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs. The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice).\n",
    "    2. Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A).\n",
    "    3. Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock, semaphore, barrier, condition, event, etc.).\n",
    "    4. Threads that acquire mutex locks in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Race Conditions</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A race condition occurs when two threads try to access a shared variable simultaneously. The first thread reads the value from the shared variable. The second thread also reads the value from the same shared variable. Then both threads try to change the value of the shared variable. And they race to see which thread writes a value to the variable last. The value from the thread that writes to the shared variable last is preserved because it overwrites the value that the previous thread wrote.\n"
