    "\n",
    "Example: If you want a good example of descriptive statistics, look no further than a student’s grade point average (GPA). A GPA gathers the data points created through a large selection of grades, classes, and exams then average them together and presents a general idea of the student’s mean academic performance. Note that the GPA doesn’t predict future performance or present any conclusions. Instead, it provides a straightforward summary of students’ academic success based on values pulled from data.\n",

    "\n",

    "<b><u>Median</u></b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "The median divides a distribution exactly in half so that 50% of the scores are at or below the median and 50% of the scores are at or above it. It is the “middle value” in a frequency distribution. When the number of data points is an odd number, the middle score is the median. For example, given 13 scores, the 7th score would be the median. When the number of data points is even, like 14, then the median is equal to the sum of the two middle scores in a frequency distribution divided by 2.\n",

    "The mode is defined as the most frequently occurring score.\n",

    "The mode is most applicable to data from a nominal level of measurement. Nominal data is classified into mutually exclusive categories, so the mode tells you the most popular category.\n",
    "For continuous variables or ratio levels of measurement, the mode may not be a helpful measure of central tendency. That’s because there are many more possible values than there are in a nominal or ordinal level of measurement. It’s unlikely for a value to repeat in a ratio level of measurement."
